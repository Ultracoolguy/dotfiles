# dotfiles
Random configs that I use

This repository was made with rcm(and git obviously) so I'll recommend you use both of them. Also, most of these configs are just modified versions of Luke Smith's voidrice, so if you want to use this I recommend you use this withhis dotfiles. Also, if I were you I'd verify this configs first, since mine have some configurations that are machine/LARBS-specific. If you want to use it as it is, you should have LARBS before.

# Thanks to:

Luke Smith - he was my main inspiration for this dotfiles(as you'll see in a lot of my files)

rofi-themes/User Themes - as a matter of fact, you should probably use one of those themes instead of mine(especially since those will be more updated and mine, for now, will be the same thing).

Anyone else who I forgot to - if you think it's very important I put you here, lemme know.
